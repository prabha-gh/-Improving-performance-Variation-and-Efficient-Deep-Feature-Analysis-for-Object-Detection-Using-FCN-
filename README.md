# Improving performance variation and Efficient Deep Feature Analysis for Object Detection Using FCN

Identifying interesting things in an image and locating them in a part of the image is a core component of computer vision. Robotics, autonomous driving and surveillance are just a few applications for this employment. Nevertheless, the need for high accuracy and speed, the changeability of item look, and the complexity of scenes make object recognition a moving issue. Methods based on deep learning have resulted in impressive improvements in object recognition in the past few years..FCN has become a well-liked deep learning architecture for the purpose of object detection due to their ability to derive useful feature representations from raw image data. The COCO dataset, which includes a wide variety of object categories, is a well-known benchmark on which FCN-based techniques have demonstrated impressive performances.
However, one of the problems with FCN-based object detection is the large range of performance variations between object categories. Due to the variations in size, shape, texture, and occlusion, which also contribute to this performance variation, the network has a difficult time learning a stable representation for all object categories. The computing complexity of FCN-based techniques can further limit their limited application to real-time scenarios.
The usefulness of our suggested methodology in addressing these challenges by decreasing performance variation and raising computing efficiency is shown by improved outcomes. The suggested FCN-based object detection framework, which seeks to lower performance variation and enhance computing efficiency, has the potential to be utilized in a variety of real-world applications. Significant contributions are made in this study. We introduce two new methods for training FCN models: a novel data augmentation strategy that improves the representation of object features, and a novel regularization technique that improves generalization to unseen data. We also suggest a cost-effective method for feature analysis that maintains good accuracy while reducing the computing complexity of the FCN architecture.The proposed framework is assessed on a number of well-known benchmarks, including COCO, PASCAL VOC, and KITTI, and contrasted against cutting-edge object detection methods. Independent driving, 76reconnaissance, and mechanical technologies were all tested.
